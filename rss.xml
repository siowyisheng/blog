&lt;h4&gt;Jigoku&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jigoku is an excellent online implementation of the excellent card game &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/legend-of-the-five-rings-the-card-game/&quot;&gt;Legend of the Five Rings&lt;/a&gt;. Game events are logged as messages in a chat area in a corner of the page, together with any chat between the players. No game replays are saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Jigoku Game Log&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jigoku Game Log goes into the DOM to extract the game events, omits superfluous information like chat messages, summarises and formats important information, and then sends this newly-produced game log to &lt;a href=&quot;https://markdownshare.com&quot;&gt;markdownshare.com&lt;/a&gt; to be saved for sharing and saving, for either analysis or sharing war stories with comrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; gave me errors, so I used &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; throughout. I guess this might be because the script is constantly ongoing and doesn‚Äôt get garbage collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submitting the game log to markdownshare.com through the fetch API was difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Chrome doesn‚Äôt allow fetch API from most areas in the extension. It needs to be done in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;background.js&lt;/code&gt;, so &lt;strong&gt;message passing&lt;/strong&gt; needs to be used to get the fetch request to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;background.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I had issues with permissions, with my request not getting sent, with no informative error logs. Turns out, there are several places to add the cross-origin site permissions to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, the API usage example on markdownshare.com showed the use of cURL. What I didn‚Äôt realise, what that cURL automatically sends the message with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ContentType:application/x-www-form-urlencoded&lt;/code&gt; when using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; option, so I needed to specify this manually with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; and I also needed to do &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;encodeURIComponent()&lt;/code&gt; on the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 10 users in the L5R community are using the extension üòä.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Writing VSCode Extensions]]></title><description><![CDATA[After writing my first chrome extension last week.

Today, I explored writing a language support vscode extension for writing TagUI scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Interesting capabilities of vscode extensions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access the filesystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register commands to the command palette.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register context menu items (when right-clicking).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display notifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get user input through a wizard (called QuickPick).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change colors of code/UI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change file icons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show info when hovering some api.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add autocomplete for a language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show information in the status bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show custom content (with WebView API).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlight syntax for a language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;On language extensions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can write a &lt;strong&gt;Language Server&lt;/strong&gt;, which is text-editor-agnostic, or just code directly for vscode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll write more as I discover more.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Working on Material UI usage page]]></title><description><![CDATA[I‚Äôm currently working on a teaching page for the usage of Material UI, since I found the concept pretty tough to grok from the docs and I‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://foreverfighter.github.io/blog3/material-ui-usage-wip/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://foreverfighter.github.io/blog3/material-ui-usage-wip/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm currently working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://siowyisheng.github.io/mui-usage/&quot;&gt;a teaching page&lt;/a&gt; for the usage of Material UI, since I found the concept pretty tough to grok from the docs and I couldn‚Äôt find good resources elsewhere, especially for Material UI v4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are well-drawn and well-designed (and have to be).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are numerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing stops me from doing so. *&lt;em&gt;moves hand&lt;/em&gt;* See?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the question is, did I move my hand because I chose and decided to? Can my conscious thought &lt;strong&gt;drive&lt;/strong&gt; this action?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Defining the question&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs start at the top. What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; consciousness? The first definition offered by a google search is ‚Äúa state of being aware of and responsive to one‚Äôs surroundings‚Äù. Two ideas are being offered here: &lt;em&gt;perception&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;responsiveness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting here in my chair, I can hear a car driving past. The sound waves reach my ear drums and my brain registers the signal. It enters my short-term memory and I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; it happens. I &lt;em&gt;perceive&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more than this. I perceive my own thoughts. I perceive myself weighing different options. I perceive my emotions, my sensations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My leg starts to get uncomfortable from being in the same position for too long. I sense the discomfort, feel that I should move it, and my brain sends the signal to my leg muscles to adjust its position. I &lt;em&gt;respond&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs interesting that these two ideas are tied together in the definition, as if they are somehow &lt;em&gt;related&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how about consciousness being a state? Is it a physical state? A mental state? What even &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a mental state? It can‚Äôt be a state of consciousness, of awareness and perception, or that would be a circular definition. Probably, what we mean by a mental state is a &lt;em&gt;physical representation&lt;/em&gt; of one‚Äôs nervous system and the chemicals, hormones and charged/discharged states of neurons in all the different sections of one‚Äôs brain. This sounds strange, but is intuitive in some way: everything else has a physical representation in the world, so why should consciousness(and by extension, conscious thought) be any different?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it all together, consciousness is the physical state of perceiving and responding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Explaining the apparent conscious direction of thought&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about conscious thought? It appears, that I am able to direct my attention, my awareness towards different directions. I can think about my fingers pressing the keys, about my breath, or the itch on my cheek. Our earlier definition of consciousness already has an answer for this. The physical system of my nervous system and brain interact, together with the input sensory data through my eyes, ears, nerves, in deterministic physical processes to go from one ‚Äúmental state‚Äù to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, there was no other way I could have responded in that situation. I couldn‚Äôt have &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; moved my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could that be? &lt;em&gt;I thought about my hand, and decided to move it, and moved it. I‚Äôve been doing this my whole life!&lt;/em&gt; Well, correlation does not imply causation. The perception of thinking about my hand, of deciding to move it, and of subsequently of it moving, does not mean that my awareness caused my hand to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For how could it? How can the immaterial affect the material? My perception is merely that, perception. The physical processes of my body are managed by the state of my neurons, my hormones. &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;(or the perception of &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;) am nothing but a passenger with a toy steering wheel in this car that is my mind. &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am a projection on the monitor that merely reflects what is happening within the CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more realistic picture of how my hand moved follows. My brain is wired to seek certain outcomes(exactly &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; outcomes is a topic for another treatise). One of those outcomes is to prove points. I was trying to make a point about conscious thought, and so my system moved my hand to prove the point, with the side-effect of my perception thinking that it was the one who did the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introducing terms for clarity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here on out, I will refer to our conscious mind and awareness, the passenger in the car as our &lt;strong&gt;consciousness&lt;/strong&gt;, and the physical systems of our brains and nervous system, together with our sensory input, which actually cause our actions as our &lt;strong&gt;mental state&lt;/strong&gt;. The consciousness is born from the mental state, as a side effect of perception for sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The consequences of determinism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our consciousness has no agency in its experiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our actions are purely a result of our mental state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The joy or tragedy of having no agency&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mental states cause the actions which make our consciousness feel good. On the other hand, they also cause our oft humanly poor behavior, but our consciousness is the one which perceives all the suffering for it. For example, Tom‚Äôs mental state might cause him to punch his boss and get fired, but his consciousness will perceive the sadness of losing his job, the guilt and the possible subsequent drop in quality of life from lost income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Punishment and reward&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should we punish someone if &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; never committed the crime? We should not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any kind of punishment, however, will always incidentally wrongly punish the blameless consciousness, for it is born from the mental state, whose future behavior we are trying to manipulate through the punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The paradox of a deterministic future&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paradox is that our thoughts have agency, our perception of our thoughts has no agency, but we cannot separate the two, as one is born from the other. So where do we go from here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the good news is that by reading and thinking about this, your mental state has &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; begun to change. It is learning that &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; is the cause of your sufferings and your joys, and that it has to step up its game, because your consciousness can‚Äôt do anything to help it. It is learning not to blame your consciousness for failures, not to praise your consciousness for successes, and to let your consciousness just &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;, unbiasedly, un-afraidly, humbly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, if I want to move my hand, my mental state can just decide to move it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
