Is it a physical state? A mental state? What even <em>is</em> a mental state? It can't be a state of consciousness, of awareness and perception, or that would be a circular definition. Probably, what we mean by a mental state is a <em>physical representation</em> of one's nervous system and the chemicals, hormones and charged/discharged states of neurons in all the different sections of one's brain. This sounds strange, but is intuitive in some way: everything else has a physical representation in the world, so why should consciousness(and by extension, conscious thought) be any different?</p>\\n<p>To put it all together, consciousness is the physical state of perceiving and responding.</p>\\n<h3>Explaining the apparent conscious direction of thought</h3>\\n<p>What about conscious thought? It appears, that I am able to direct my attention, my awareness towards different directions. I can think about my fingers pressing the keys, about my breath, or the itch on my cheek. Our earlier definition of consciousness already has an answer for this. The physical system of my nervous system and brain interact, together with the input sensory data through my eyes, ears, nerves, in deterministic physical processes to go from one \\\"mental state\\\" to the next.</p>\\n<p>In other words, there was no other way I could have responded in that situation. I couldn't have <strong>not</strong> moved my hand.</p>\\n<p>How could that be? <em>I thought about my hand, and decided to move it, and moved it. I've been doing this my whole life!</em> Well, correlation does not imply causation. The perception of thinking about my hand, of deciding to move it, and of subsequently of it moving, does not mean that my awareness caused my hand to move.</p>\\n<p>For how could it? How can the immaterial affect the material? My perception is merely that, perception. The physical processes of my body are managed by the state of my neurons, my hormones. <em>I</em>(or the perception of <em>I</em>) am nothing but a passenger with a toy steering wheel in this car that is my mind. <em>I</em> am a projection on the monitor that merely reflects what is happening within the CPU.</p>\\n<p>A more realistic picture of how my hand moved follows.
