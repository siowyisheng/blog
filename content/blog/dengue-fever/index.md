Life often finds a way to mess with your plans. Just when I want to blog more, I get hit with dengue fever.

Worst sickness of my past 10 years at least. High fever, a headache so bad I don't even want to look at any screen for days, lethargy, widespread itchy rash. It's a nasty melange of symptoms.

But it's over now. I have a draft in progress for literotica. Hope I can finish it this week ðŸ˜€.
